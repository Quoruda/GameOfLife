# Game of life

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the Game of Life in Java.
For now, the rule respect the original rule of Conway's Game of Life, 
but it is easily modifiable.

I would like to add a feature to change the rule thanks to the navbar.
## Inputs

You can interact with the simulation with the following inputs:

| Input               | Actions                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| G                   | show/hide grid          |
| Space               | pause/resume simulation |
| directionnal arrows | move                    |
| Mouse wheel         | zoom                    |


## Edit
If the simulation is paused, you can change the state of the cells by clicking on them.
